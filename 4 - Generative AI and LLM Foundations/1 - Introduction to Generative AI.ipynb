    "## 👋 Welcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructor:** (Unnamed Presenter)  \n",
    "**Lesson:** Introduction to Generative AI  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **Generative AI**, an exciting and transformative field within artificial intelligence.  \n",
    "Before diving into applications, let’s first understand **what AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)** are — and how **Generative AI (GenAI)** fits within this hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the **ability of machines to imitate human intelligence**.  \n",
    "It enables computers to **analyze data**, **learn from experiences**, and **make decisions** similar to how humans do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within AI, we have **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** as its key subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** is a subset of AI where **algorithms learn from historical data** to:\n",
    "- Predict outcomes on new data, and  \n",
    "- Identify patterns or trends from existing data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In ML, models are **trained** using data, so they can make predictions (for example, classifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning** is a more advanced form of Machine Learning that uses **neural networks** to process **complex and high-dimensional data**.  \n",
    "These networks can automatically extract features and relationships from data, making DL particularly effective in areas like:\n",
    "- Image recognition  \n",
    "- Natural language processing  \n",
    "- Speech and video understanding  \n",

    "## 🌟 What is Generative AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, **Generative AI** is a type of AI that can **create new content**.  \n",
    "It doesn’t just analyze data — it **generates new outputs** based on what it has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Generative AI Outputs:\n",
    "- **Text:** Articles, stories, summaries, or dialogues  \n",
    "- **Images:** Artwork, illustrations, or realistic photos  \n",
    "- **Audio:** Music, speech, or sound effects  \n",
    "- **Video:** Animations, simulations, or realistic renderings  \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, **Generative AI** is a **subset of Deep Learning** that trains models to **generate original content** by understanding and replicating data patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 How Does Generative AI Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a **Generative AI model** learns the **underlying structure** of a dataset and uses that knowledge to **generate new, similar data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Example:\n",
    "Imagine teaching a GenAI model to **draw a dog**:\n",
    "1. You provide it with thousands of pictures of dogs.  \n",
    "2. The model studies common features — like fur texture, ears, or shape.  \n",
    "3. Once trained, the model can generate **a new image of a dog** that looks realistic but is **not copied** from any training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves **complex mathematical modeling** and **neural network architectures**, but conceptually, it’s all about **pattern learning and generation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Generative AI vs Traditional Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s compare **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Generative AI (GenAI):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Machine Learning (ML) | Generative AI (GenAI) |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Goal** | Predict or classify outcomes | Create new content |\n",
    "| **Data Type** | Structured and labeled | Unstructured or unlabeled |\n",
    "| **Learning Approach** | Learns mapping between data and labels | Learns data patterns and structure |\n",
    "| **Output** | Predictions or classifications | Generated text, images, or media |\n",
    "| **Training** | Supervised (data + labels) | Unsupervised or semi-supervised |\n",
    "| **Use Cases** | Forecasting, classification, recommendation | Content creation, design, automation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Example\n",
    "- **ML Model:** Given an image → predicts “dog” or “cat.”  \n",
    "- **GenAI Model:** Given a pattern → generates a **new dog image** never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Training and Inference in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In **supervised machine learning**, models are trained using:\n",
    "- **Input features** (like shape, color, or texture)\n",
    "- **Output labels** (like “cat” or “dog”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, the model can **infer** (predict) outcomes for **unlabeled data**.  \n",
    "Generative AI differs by not requiring labeled data — it learns **patterns in unstructured data** instead.\n",
