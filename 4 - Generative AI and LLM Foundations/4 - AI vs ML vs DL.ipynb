    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Lesson Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will walk through **a couple of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI Services**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vision AI Service**  \n",
    "2. **AI Language Service**\n",
    "\n",
    "These services provide ready-to-use AI capabilities for analyzing images, documents, and text — with minimal effort or model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👁️ OCI Vision AI Service\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Vision AI Service** allows us to carry out several computer vision tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image Classification**  \n",
    "- **Object Detection**  \n",
    "- **Text Detection**  \n",
    "- **Document AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s explore each of these features with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This task identifies **labels** that describe the content of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🖼️ Example 1: Vegetation Image\n",
    "\n",
    "- The image was analyzed and labeled as **“vegetation.”**  \n",
    "- The **confidence score** was **99.23%**, meaning the AI service is very confident that vegetation exists in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🖼️ Example 2: Zebra Image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detected labels include **zebra**, **grassland**, **animal**, **plant**, and **vegetation**.\n",
    "- Each label comes with a confidence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🖼️ Example 3: Two Zebras Image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detected **zebra**, **animal**, **vegetation**, **sky**, and **mammal**.  \n",
    "- The system identifies multiple entities within one frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Detection identifies multiple **individual objects** within an image and draws **bounding boxes** around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛣️ Example 1: Traffic Image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detected **multiple cars**, **taxis**, and **people**.  \n",
    "- Each object has a **bounding box** and a **confidence score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🍎 Example 2: Basket of Fruit\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detected **oranges**, **bananas**, **apples**, and even a **bowl**.  \n",
    "- Each detected object was labeled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔤 Text Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Detection extracts **written text** from images, regardless of font, size, or background.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚌 Example 1: Bus Image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracted all visible text, including **number plates (e.g., M32HOD)** and other **signs and numbers (e.g., 45)**.\n",
    "- Detected small and large text blocks accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🖋️ Example 2: Fonts Image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracted text in **different fonts and styles**, scanning **line by line**.\n",
    "- Correctly recognized words like “Arial” and “Arial Black” in their respective font styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Document AI\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Document AI has been moved to a separate service called **Document Understanding**, but the features remain similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧾 Example: Receipt Image\n",
    "\n",
    "The system analyzed a receipt image and performed multiple tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracted **raw text** (from “Receipt” to “Thank You”).  \n",
    "- Identified **key-value pairs**, such as:\n",
    "  - **Transaction Date**\n",
    "  - **Transaction Time**\n",
    "  - **Subtotal**\n",
    "  - **Tax**\n",
    "  - **Total**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Table Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- The service extracted **three tables**:\n",
    "  1. **Itemized details**\n",
    "  2. **Total summary**\n",
    "  3. **Payment information** (e.g., card authorization code, terminal ID, amount)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💬 OCI AI Language Service\n",

    "1. Input a block of text in English.  \n",
    "2. Choose the target language (e.g., French).  \n",
    "3. Click “Translate.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Output is instantly translated into the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Custom Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "OCI Language Service also supports **custom model training**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload your **own text data**.  \n",
    "- Train **custom models** tailored for domain-specific terminology or specialized content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
