    "# Lesson: AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai**.  \n",
    "**Instructor:** *Michelle Malcher, Director in Database Product Management.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we’ll explore how **Oracle Database 23ai** has built-in vector search capabilities that enable semantic data retrieval and power modern Generative AI (GenAI) pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of AI Vector Search\n",
    "AI Vector Search is **natively integrated** into Oracle Database 23ai.  \n",
    "This capability allows efficient searches based on semantics across both **structured** and **unstructured** data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike single-purpose vector databases, Oracle Database 23ai is a **converged database**, supporting:\n",
    "- JSON  \n",
    "- XML  \n",
    "- Graph  \n",
    "- Spatial  \n",
    "- Text  \n",
    "- Relational  \n",
    "- Vectors  \n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-model support allows unified, data-driven workloads and simplifies AI pipeline development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "AI Vector Search provides:\n",
    "- **SQL support** for native vector generation  \n",
    "- **VECTOR datatype** for storing embeddings  \n",
    "- **SQL functions and syntax** for similarity searches  \n",
    "- **Approximate search indexing** for high performance and accuracy  \n",
    "\n",
    "These features enable developers to embed and search vector data directly within SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using AI Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Generating Vector Embeddings\n",
    "Models can be used via API calls or loaded directly (e.g., **ONNX models**).  \n",
    "Example: The model `resnet_50` is loaded into the database.  \n",
    "You can use the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "VECTOR_EMBEDDING(model_name, query_input)\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates a vector representation of the input (e.g., an image or text).\n",
    "The embeddings can then be stored in the database for similarity comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Performing Similarity Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "The **VECTOR_DISTANCE** function computes similarity between two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **smaller distance** → higher similarity.\n",
    "* The **distance metric** (e.g., cosine) can be adjusted based on the model used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example SQL snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT TOP 10 * \n",
    "FROM candidates c, jobs j\n",
    "WHERE VECTOR_DISTANCE(c.resume_vec, j.job_vec) < threshold;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query finds the top 10 job matches for a candidate based on vector similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Vector Tables and Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VECTOR` datatype can be added to tables alongside relational data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE images (\n",
    "  image_id NUMBER,\n",
    "  image_vec VECTOR(1024)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables flexible schema evolution — as newer embedding models appear, the schema remains compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating vector indexes improves both **speed** and **accuracy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VECTOR INDEX idx_images ON images (image_vec)\n",
    "ORGANIZATION INMEMORY NEIGHBOR GRAPH\n",
    "DISTANCE COSINE\n",
    "TARGET ACCURACY 0.9;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **INMEMORY NEIGHBOR GRAPH** for in-memory performance\n",
    "* **NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS** for disk-based indexing\n",
    "* **TARGET ACCURACY** to specify search precision\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approximate vs. Exact Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `APPROXIMATE` keyword in SQL fetch clauses allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT APPROXIMATE TOP 5 ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This balances performance and accuracy.\n",
    "For example, **80% target accuracy** returns approximately 4 out of 5 correct matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no vector index exists, Oracle automatically falls back to **exact search** for reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Use Case: Similarity Search over Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Oracle’s optimizer enables **joins across vectorized and relational tables** — a key differentiator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT b.book_title\n",
    "FROM authors a, books b, pages p\n",
    "WHERE VECTOR_DISTANCE(p.page_vec, qVec) < threshold\n",
    "AND b.genre = 'Fiction'\n",
    "AND a.country = 'India'\n",
    "FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves books most semantically similar to a given query text, filtered by genre and author origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration with GenAI Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Vector Search powers the **end-to-end GenAI workflow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Sources** – Databases, CSVs, or social media.\n",
    "2. **Document Loading** – Ingest and transform documents.\n",
    "3. **Embedding Generation** – Use ML models to create vectors.\n",
    "4. **Similarity Search** – Retrieve semantically similar items.\n",
    "5. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – Interact with LLMs using contextually relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oracle Database 23ai integrates seamlessly with **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**, empowering developers to build advanced GenAI apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Oracle Database 23ai Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fully **integrated** vector storage and retrieval\n",
    "* Enterprise-grade **performance and reliability**\n",
    "* Unified **SQL processing** for all data types\n",
    "* **Simplified orchestration** of GenAI pipelines\n",
    "* Compatibility with **third-party frameworks**\n",
