    "# Lesson: Natural Language Queries in Oracle Autonomous Database (Select AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **Natural Language Queries in Oracle Autonomous Database**.  \n",
    "**Instructor:** *Michelle Malcher, Director in Database Product Management.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we’ll explore **Select AI**, a feature in Oracle Autonomous Database that allows users to query data using **natural language**. You’ll learn how Select AI integrates large language models (LLMs) to interpret user questions and automatically generate SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Oracle AI Landscape\n",
    "Oracle provides AI to enterprises at every layer—from infrastructure to applications.  \n",
    "In this lesson, we focus on the **data layer**, where Oracle Autonomous Database integrates with **large language models** to analyze and return results using natural language queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand what **Select AI** is and how it works.  \n",
    "- Use **natural language** to query your data.  \n",
    "- Explore the **SQL query generation process**.  \n",
    "- Recognize how Select AI enables AI-powered applications securely and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Select AI?\n",
    "**Select AI** in Oracle Autonomous Database allows you to get insights from your data **without knowing SQL syntax** or the structure of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply ask your question in plain language — for example:\n",
    "> “What are the top 10 streamed movies?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Autonomous Database connects to a **large language model**, engineers an optimized prompt for your data source, and returns:\n",
    "- A **result set**\n",
    "- A **narrative summary**\n",
    "- Or the **generated SQL query**\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is done automatically and securely within Oracle’s environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration: Using Select AI in APEX\n",
    "Oracle APEX allows you to build applications that integrate with **Select AI**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "1. **Ask:** “Show me the top 10 streamed movies.”  \n",
    "   - The database returns the results instantly.  \n",
    "2. **Ask:** “Which actors are in those movies?”  \n",
    "   - Select AI generates and executes the appropriate SQL.  \n",
    "3. **Ask:** “How many movies were streamed in total?”  \n",
    "   - You can visualize the data through **APEX interactive reports** or **charts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easy to explore your data dynamically — without knowing table names, columns, or SQL joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Viewing the SQL Query\n",
    "Select AI also provides transparency. You can view the generated SQL using:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AI SHOWSQL;\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This reveals the full query, including the tables and joins used to produce the result set.\n",
    "This helps developers **verify accuracy** and **refine questions** for deeper insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Querying with Select AI\n",
    "\n",
    "You can query the database directly using **SQL Developer** or similar tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AI 'Show me the total revenue for 2024 by region';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of specifying the `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses, the Select AI engine handles the prompt interpretation, query generation, and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how **Select AI** works behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user enters a natural language query.\n",
    "2. The Autonomous Database sends the question to the configured **LLM**.\n",
    "3. The LLM interprets the intent and infers necessary joins and filters.\n",
    "4. Select AI generates the corresponding **SQL query**.\n",
    "5. The database executes it and returns the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can continue refining your question to get different insights or levels of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Profiles and Pluggability\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key design principles of Select AI is **pluggability**.\n",
    "This flexibility is managed through an **AI Profile**, which defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **LLM provider** (e.g., OCI Generative AI, Cohere, OpenAI, Llama)\n",
    "* The **schemas, tables, and views** to include in processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers can configure AI Profiles using the PL/SQL package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plsql\n",
    "DBMS_CLOUD_AI\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows full control over which data sources participate and which AI models are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security and Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Oracle ensures your data remains **secure** and **private**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your data never leaves the Oracle Cloud tenancy.\n",
    "* Queries and responses stay within your secure environment.\n",
    "* No third-party LLM provider can access or view your organization’s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enterprise-grade security model makes Select AI safe for business-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Query Generation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see a practical example of Select AI in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Find the top customer segments for George Clooney movies.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The AI Profile defines the LLM and data sources.\n",
    "2. Select AI constructs a precise prompt from the question.\n",
    "3. The LLM generates the SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT customer_segment, COUNT(*) AS movie_views\n",
    "   FROM movies\n",
    "   JOIN customers USING (customer_id)\n",
    "   WHERE actor_name = 'George Clooney'\n",
    "   GROUP BY customer_segment\n",
    "   ORDER BY movie_views DESC;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. The results or SQL statement are returned to the user or app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building AI-Enabled Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Select AI, developers can easily integrate **Generative AI** capabilities into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Existing business applications\n",
    "* New AI-driven data exploration tools\n",
    "\n",
    "With Oracle APEX or other interfaces, users can interact with their data through natural conversations rather than technical queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Select AI\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ease of use:** Query data using natural language.\n",
    "* **Transparency:** Review and verify generated SQL.\n",
    "* **Flexibility:** Choose from multiple LLM providers.\n",
    "* **Security:** Data remains within your Oracle tenancy.\n",
    "* **Future-enabled:** Compatible with new or fine-tuned AI models.\n",
