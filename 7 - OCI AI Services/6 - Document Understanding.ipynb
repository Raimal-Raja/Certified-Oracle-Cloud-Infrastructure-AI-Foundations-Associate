    "# Lesson: Understanding OCI Document AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **OCI Document AI**, one of the two main capabilities of **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Vision**.  \n",
    "While **Image Analysis** focuses on photographic images, **Document AI** is designed specifically for **document images** — enabling organizations to extract, classify, and interpret textual and tabular data from scanned documents and photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will understand:\n",
    "- What **OCI Document AI** is used for  \n",
    "- The supported **document types and formats**  \n",
    "- The core **features** and their practical applications\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: What is OCI Document AI?\n",
    "**Document AI** is an advanced capability of OCI Vision that enables you to process and analyze **document-based images**.  \n",
    "It helps you understand files such as:\n",
    "- **PDF documents**\n",
    "- **Scanned images** (JPEG, PNG, TIFF)\n",
    "- **Photographs containing text** (e.g., photos of receipts or contracts)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to automatically extract structured information from these documents without manual data entry or extensive preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Text Recognition (OCR)\n",
    "The first major feature of Document AI is **Text Recognition**, also known as **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature:\n",
    "- Extracts **text from document images**.\n",
    "- Handles **complex cases**, including:\n",
    "  - **Handwritten text**\n",
    "  - **Tilted or rotated documents**\n",
    "  - **Shaded or noisy backgrounds**\n",
    "\n",
    "OCR enables you to digitize printed or handwritten content, making it searchable and analyzable.  \n",
    "For example, you can take a photo of an old invoice or a handwritten note and convert it into editable and searchable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Document Classification\n",
    "Another core feature is **Document Classification**.  \n",
    "This capability automatically categorizes documents into one of **ten different document types**, based on:\n",
    "- **Visual appearance**\n",
    "- **High-level layout features**\n",
    "- **Extracted keywords**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common categories include:\n",
    "- **Invoice**\n",
    "- **Receipt**\n",
    "- **Resume**\n",
    "- **Contract**\n",
    "- **Form**\n",
    "- **Identity document**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful in automation workflows — for example, when you need to route invoices to finance, resumes to HR, or receipts to expense processing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Language Detection\n",
    "Document AI also performs **Language Detection**, which determines the language used in a document.  \n",
    "Unlike typical language models that rely on text patterns, this system uses **visual features** of text — such as font, layout, and symbols — to identify the language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows accurate detection even when documents contain:\n",
    "- Mixed languages\n",
    "- Stylized or decorative fonts\n",
    "- Non-standard characters\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Table Extraction\n",
    "A standout feature of OCI Document AI is **Table Extraction**.  \n",
    "This function identifies **tables** within documents and extracts their content into **structured tabular form**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- A financial report with embedded tables\n",
    "- A purchase order containing itemized lists\n",
    "- A data sheet with specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature allows developers and analysts to directly feed the extracted tabular data into spreadsheets, databases, or downstream analytics systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Key-Value Extraction\n",
    "Finally, **Key-Value Extraction** is one of the most powerful features for business document processing.  \n",
    "It detects and extracts **specific fields and line items** from common business documents such as receipts or invoices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of automatically recognized fields include:\n",
    "- **Merchant Name**\n",
    "- **Transaction Date**\n",
    "- **Invoice Number**\n",
    "- **Total Amount**\n",
    "- **Tax**\n",
    "- **Payment Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "Document AI currently supports **13 predefined key fields**, and can also extract **line items** such as product descriptions and prices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This automation significantly reduces manual effort in expense management, billing, and procurement workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Summary\n",
    "Let’s recap what we’ve learned about **OCI Document AI**:\n",
    "- It processes **document images** like PDFs, TIFFs, and JPEGs.  \n",
    "- It performs **Text Recognition (OCR)** for typed and handwritten content.  \n",
    "- It uses **Document Classification** to identify document types.  \n",
    "- It includes **Language Detection** to recognize the document’s language visually.  \n",
    "- It performs **Table Extraction** and **Key-Value Extraction** to structure the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these features make OCI Document AI an essential tool for transforming unstructured document images into structured, analyzable digital data — streamlining document processing and business automation.\n",
