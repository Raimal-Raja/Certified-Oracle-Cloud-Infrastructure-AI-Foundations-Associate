    "# Lesson: Exploring OCI Language in the Oracle Cloud Console\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **OCI Language** within the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console**.  \n",
    "In this session, we’ll explore how to access the service, navigate its interface, and perform text analysis using the built-in tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "OCI Language is one of Oracle’s AI Services under the **Analytics & AI** category. It provides powerful capabilities such as **language detection**, **text classification**, **entity recognition**, **key phrase extraction**, and **sentiment analysis** — all available through a simple console interface or API.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing OCI Language\n",
    "To begin, log in to your **OCI Console**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the **Console Home Screen**, open the **Navigation Menu**.  \n",
    "2. Navigate to **Analytics & AI → AI Services → Language**.  \n",
    "3. This opens the **OCI Language Service page**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your tenancy setup, your console’s layout might look slightly different. However, the **Language** option will always appear under **AI Services**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## OCI Language Service Overview\n",
    "On the **Language Service page**, you’ll find several useful resources:\n",
    "- **Documentation Links** for deeper learning on specific topics.  \n",
    "- **API Reference** and **SDK Guides** for developers integrating the service programmatically.  \n",
    "- **Blogs and Tutorials** that explain real-world applications of OCI Language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These resources make it easy to learn about the service, explore new features, and start building AI-powered text analysis workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trying Out the Service\n",
    "Now, let’s try out the **Text Analytics** feature directly from the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on **Text Analytics** from the OCI Language page.  \n",
    "2. You’ll see a **default text sample** preloaded in the input box.  \n",
    "3. Click the **Analyze** button to process the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCI Language service will automatically perform multiple layers of analysis and display the results in organized sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Analysis Results\n",
    "After running the analysis, you’ll see several key components generated by the service:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Language Detection\n",
    "- Detects the **language** of the text (in this case, *English*).  \n",
    "- Displays a **confidence score**, indicating how certain the model is about the detection.  \n",
    "- For example: *Language: English (Confidence: 0.99)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Text Classification\n",
    "- Categorizes the text into **main topic** and **subtopic**.  \n",
    "- Example output:\n",
    "  - **Category:** Science and Technology  \n",
    "  - **Subcategory:** Earth Sciences  \n",
    "  - **Confidence:** Moderate  \n",
    "- This helps understand the general subject of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "- Identifies and highlights **entities** in the text, such as:\n",
    "  - **Locations**\n",
    "  - **Products**\n",
    "  - **Quantities**\n",
    "  - **Dates and Times**\n",
    "- Each entity is color-coded and includes:\n",
    "  - The **entity name**\n",
    "  - The **type of entity**\n",
    "  - A **confidence score**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "> *“NASA launched the satellite in 2022.”*  \n",
    "> Entities detected:  \n",
    "> - “NASA” → *Organization*  \n",
    "> - “2022” → *Date*  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Key Phrase Extraction\n",
    "- Lists the **important phrases or concepts** extracted from the text.  \n",
    "- These key phrases summarize the main ideas without rewriting the full content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "> Extracted Key Phrases: *satellite system, Earth observation, orbit patterns.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "OCI Language provides **three types** of sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Document-Level Sentiment\n",
    "- Evaluates the **overall emotion** of the entire text.  \n",
    "- Example: *Mixed sentiment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Aspect-Based Sentiment\n",
    "- Focuses on **specific aspects or topics** identified within the text.  \n",
    "- Assigns a sentiment to each aspect, such as *positive*, *neutral*, or *negative*.  \n",
    "- Example: *Technology – Negative; Cost – Negative.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Sentence-Level Sentiment\n",
    "- Analyzes each sentence separately.  \n",
    "- Assigns one of the three possible sentiments to each:\n",
    "  - **Positive**\n",
    "  - **Neutral**\n",
    "  - **Negative**\n",
    "- Provides a more granular understanding of tone across the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Through the OCI Console, **OCI Language** enables users to perform comprehensive text analysis quickly and intuitively.  \n",
    "In this lesson, you learned how to:\n",
    "- Access OCI Language via the **Analytics & AI** menu.  \n",
    "- Use **Text Analytics** to process and interpret text data.  \n",
    "- Understand results such as **language detection**, **classification**, **entity recognition**, **key phrase extraction**, and **sentiment analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "OCI Language is a versatile service for extracting insights from unstructured text, empowering data analysts, developers, and businesses to derive meaningful conclusions from their data — all within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n",
