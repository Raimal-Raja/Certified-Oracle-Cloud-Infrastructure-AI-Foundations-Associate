    "# Lesson: Using OCI Speech in the Console – Creating a Transcription Job\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **using OCI Speech in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console**.  \n",
    "In this session, we’ll walk through the steps required to **create and run a speech-to-text transcription job** using the OCI Speech service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll learn how to:\n",
    "- Navigate to the Speech service in the OCI Console  \n",
    "- Prepare data in Object Storage  \n",
    "- Create and execute a transcription job  \n",
    "- View and interpret the transcription results  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Accessing the OCI Speech Service\n",
    "Start by signing in to the **OCI Console**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the main console page, open the **Navigation Menu**.  \n",
    "2. Go to **Analytics & AI**.  \n",
    "3. Under **AI Services**, select **Speech**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will take you to the **OCI Speech service console page**, where you can manage transcription jobs, review previous tasks, and create new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Preparing Data in Object Storage\n",
    "Before creating a transcription job, you need to have your **audio files** stored in **Object Storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OCI Speech processes data directly from your Object Storage bucket.  \n",
    "- Supported audio formats include **.wav**, **.mp3**, and **.mp4** (depending on encoding).  \n",
    "- Ensure that your bucket and files are in the **same compartment** that you plan to use for the transcription job.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the instructor has already uploaded a `.wav` file to an Object Storage bucket within the selected compartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Creating a Transcription Job\n",
    "Now, let’s create the transcription job.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the **Speech service console page**, click **Create Transcription Job**.  \n",
    "2. Enter a name for the job — here we’ll call it **Training**.  \n",
    "3. Confirm that the correct **compartment** is selected.  \n",
    "4. Choose the **Object Storage bucket** that contains your audio file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The console will display the available files in the selected bucket.  \n",
    "Select the desired **.wav** file (in this example, the instructor’s previously uploaded file).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Running the Job\n",
    "Once the configuration is complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click **Run Job** to start the transcription process.  \n",
    "- The job typically takes **only a few seconds** to complete (depending on file size).  \n",
    "- You can monitor the job status on the console — it will move from **In Progress** to **Succeeded** once complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the instructor had run this job several times before, the result appeared very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Viewing the Transcription Results\n",
    "After the job status changes to **Succeeded**, select the file to view the transcription output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting text from the example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “I’m having an issue with my wireless headphones. I think my Bluetooth connectivity to the TV is not working. I have high-quality headphones. I know the issue is not with them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And then a second voice responds:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Hi, thanks for contacting support. I’m sorry to hear about your Bluetooth issue.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how **OCI Speech** accurately transcribes multiple speakers and maintains the **flow and clarity** of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Observing Additional Features\n",
    "When reviewing the transcription results, note a few important enhancements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Punctuation:**  \n",
    "  The output includes proper punctuation marks (periods, commas, and capitalization), making the text easier to read and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization:**  \n",
    "  Numbers and special terms are automatically formatted.  \n",
    "  For example, instead of spelling out “one hundred percent,” the transcription shows **100%**, reflecting natural written conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features greatly improve the readability and usability of the transcribed text for downstream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lesson, you learned how to use **OCI Speech via the Console** to create and run a transcription job.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We covered how to:\n",
    "- Access OCI Speech from the **Analytics & AI** section  \n",
    "- Prepare and select audio data from **Object Storage**  \n",
    "- Create, run, and monitor a **transcription job**  \n",
    "- Review accurate, punctuated, and normalized text output  \n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can easily transform audio recordings into high-quality text — ready for analysis, captioning, or further AI processing.\n",
