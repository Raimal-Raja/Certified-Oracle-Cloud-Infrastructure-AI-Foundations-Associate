    "# Lesson: Exploring OCI Speech – Speech-to-Text in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **OCI Speech**, Oracle’s speech-to-text service in **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**.  \n",
    "In this session, we’ll explore how OCI Speech works, what makes it powerful, and how it can transform spoken content into high-quality, readable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "OCI Speech leverages **advanced deep learning models** and **Oracle’s acoustic language models** to automatically transcribe audio and video files into accurate, timestamped text. The service is designed for developers and enterprises who want to extract textual data from multimedia content — **without requiring data science expertise**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OCI Speech?\n",
    "**OCI Speech** is an AI-powered service that converts **speech into text** with high accuracy. It unlocks the data contained in audio or video recordings by transcribing spoken words into written text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This transcription capability enables organizations to:\n",
    "- Make media content **searchable** and **analyzable**\n",
    "- Generate **captions and subtitles**\n",
    "- Improve **accessibility** and **automation**\n",
    "- Streamline **data processing pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "The service processes audio directly from **Object Storage** and outputs structured text with **timestamps** and **confidence scores** for each word or segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of OCI Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Automatic Transcription**\n",
    "OCI Speech automatically converts speech in audio or video files into grammatically correct text using deep learning.  \n",
    "No machine learning or data science background is required — simply upload your files and retrieve the transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Multi-Language Support**\n",
    "The service currently supports multiple languages:\n",
    "- **English**\n",
    "- **Spanish**\n",
    "- **Portuguese**  \n",
    "*(More languages are planned for future updates.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "This multilingual capability enables global accessibility for developers and enterprises working with international audio sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Batch Processing**\n",
    "OCI Speech includes **batching support**, meaning multiple audio or video files can be transcribed in a single API call.  \n",
    "This feature streamlines workflows and increases efficiency when processing large volumes of media data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **High-Speed Processing**\n",
    "One of OCI Speech’s most impressive strengths is its **speed**.  \n",
    "It can transcribe **hours of audio in under 10 minutes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It achieves this through **parallel processing**:\n",
    "- The system **divides audio into smaller chunks**.  \n",
    "- Each chunk is transcribed independently using Oracle’s models.  \n",
    "- The service then **reassembles the transcribed segments** into a single, coherent output file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This parallelization ensures both speed and accuracy without sacrificing quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Confidence Scoring**\n",
    "OCI Speech provides:\n",
    "- A **confidence score per word**, indicating how certain the model is about each transcription.  \n",
    "- An **overall confidence score per transcript**, summarizing the reliability of the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These scores help developers assess transcription accuracy and apply post-processing or verification steps as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Automatic Punctuation**\n",
    "The service **automatically punctuates** transcriptions, improving readability and making the text easier for downstream systems to process.  \n",
    "For example, spoken sentences like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “welcome to oracle speech today we’re going to talk about ai models”  \n",
    "\n",
    "are transcribed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Welcome to Oracle Speech. Today, we’re going to talk about AI models.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **SRT File Support (Closed Captions)**\n",
    "OCI Speech supports the **SRT file format**, which is the most widely used format for closed captions in video content.  \n",
    "This feature allows users to:\n",
    "- Generate **caption files** for videos automatically.  \n",
    "- Integrate these captions into **media players** or **streaming platforms**.  \n",
    "- Improve accessibility for audiences with hearing impairments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Text Normalization**\n",
    "OCI Speech applies **text normalization**, converting raw, literal transcriptions into more human-readable forms.  \n",
    "It normalizes elements such as:\n",
    "- **Numbers** (e.g., “twenty one” → “21”)  \n",
    "- **Addresses**  \n",
    "- **Times**  \n",
    "- **URLs**\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the final transcript resembles natural written language rather than a word-for-word transcription of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Raw Transcription | Normalized Output |\n",
    "|-------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| “call me at one two three main street at five o’clock” | “Call me at 123 Main Street at 5:00.” |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Profanity Filtering**\n",
    "OCI Speech includes built-in **profanity filtering** for sensitive content.  \n",
    "It offers three handling modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description | Example |\n",
    "|------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Remove** | Replaces profane words with asterisks | “That was **** amazing.” |\n",
    "| **Mask** | Keeps the first letter, hides the rest | “That was f*** amazing.” |\n",
    "| **Tag** | Leaves the word but tags it in metadata | “That was [profanity] amazing.” |\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature ensures safe and customizable content moderation across use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "OCI Speech is a **fast, accurate, and developer-friendly** service that transforms spoken words into structured, readable text.  \n",
    "It’s ideal for applications such as:\n",
    "- Media transcription  \n",
    "- Accessibility and captioning  \n",
    "- Call center analytics  \n",
    "- Meeting and lecture documentation  \n",
