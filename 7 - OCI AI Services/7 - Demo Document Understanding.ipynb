    "# Lesson: Exploring Document AI in the OCI Console\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, we’ll explore **OCI Document AI** in action using real examples in the **OCI Console**.  \n",
    "You’ll see how Document AI extracts text, identifies key-value pairs, and organizes tabular data from scanned document images such as **receipts** and **invoices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on exploration demonstrates how effectively OCI Document AI transforms unstructured document images into structured, machine-readable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Working with a Sample Receipt\n",
    "When you open the **Document AI** service in the OCI Console, the default image presented is a **receipt**.  \n",
    "Immediately, Document AI detects that the **language** of the document is **English**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Extraction\n",
    "The system highlights all the text regions in the image — every line, word, and character.  \n",
    "You can view the extracted content in two formats:\n",
    "- **Line format** – showing complete sentences or lines of text  \n",
    "- **Word format** – breaking down each individual word detected\n",
    "\n",
    "This full extraction provides a complete digital version of the document’s text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Key-Value Extraction from the Receipt\n",
    "Next, let’s examine **key-value extraction** — one of Document AI’s most powerful receipt-processing features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Document AI automatically searches for a set of **predefined keys** commonly found in receipts.  \n",
    "When it identifies a value associated with one of these keys, it extracts and assigns it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "From the sample receipt, the following key-value pairs are identified:\n",
    "- **Merchant Name:** Example Café  \n",
    "- **Merchant Address:** Extracted from the top section of the receipt  \n",
    "- **Merchant Phone Number:** Detected near the header or footer  \n",
    "- **Transaction Time:** Extracted from the printed timestamp  \n",
    "- **Transaction Date:** Identified near the payment details  \n",
    "\n",
    "This level of structured extraction is extremely useful for **expense reporting** and **automated financial workflows**, allowing you to process receipts without manual entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Line Item and Tabular Data Extraction\n",
    "Document AI doesn’t stop at key-value pairs — it also extracts **tabular data** and **line items**.  \n",
    "For example, from the same receipt, the model identifies:\n",
    "- **Two line items:**  \n",
    "  - Americano  \n",
    "  - Water  \n",
    "\n",
    "It recognizes each item, its description, and associated values (like price or quantity) and presents them in a **structured table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This capability allows downstream systems — such as expense management software — to directly ingest itemized data from receipts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Processing an Invoice Example\n",
    "Now, let’s explore a different document type — an **invoice**.  \n",
    "When uploaded to Document AI, you’ll again see that **all text elements** on the image are detected and highlighted.  \n",
    "The extracted text includes both printed and **handwritten** information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Complex Visuals\n",
    "This invoice contains a **stamp** added after processing by the accounts payable team.  \n",
    "Despite the stamp being partially faded and handwritten, Document AI still captures portions of the text that are legible.  \n",
    "It processes the document as a whole without being confused by:\n",
    "- The **overlay of the stamp**\n",
    "- **Handwritten notes**\n",
    "- **Irregular scanning quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Tabular Data from Invoices\n",
    "Even though **key-value extraction** is not applied to invoices in this example, Document AI successfully extracts **tabular data** such as:\n",
    "- **Quantities**\n",
    "- **Descriptions**\n",
    "- **Unit prices**\n",
    "- **Total amounts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, it also detects some text from the stamp and classifies it as part of the **description column** — showing how robustly it captures all visible content without disrupting structured fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to extract detailed line items makes Document AI invaluable for automating **invoice processing**, **data entry**, and **financial reconciliation** workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Summary\n",
    "In this lesson, you explored **OCI Document AI** through live examples using the OCI Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned that Document AI:\n",
    "- Detects document language automatically  \n",
    "- Extracts **all text** from receipts and invoices  \n",
    "- Identifies **key-value pairs** in receipts (merchant name, date, totals, etc.)  \n",
    "- Recognizes **line items and tabular data** from both receipts and invoices  \n",
    "- Handles **handwritten and stamped text** with impressive accuracy  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these features demonstrate how OCI Document AI transforms raw document images into structured, usable digital data — dramatically improving efficiency in business document processing.\n",
