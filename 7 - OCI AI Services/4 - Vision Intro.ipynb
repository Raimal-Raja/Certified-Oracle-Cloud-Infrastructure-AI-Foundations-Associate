    "# Lesson: Introduction to OCI Vision – Image Analysis and Document AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Vision**.  \n",
    "OCI Vision is a **computer vision service** that enables developers and data scientists to analyze images and documents using prebuilt or custom-trained AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we’ll explore the key features of OCI Vision and understand how it helps automate visual data interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn about:\n",
    "- The two main capabilities of OCI Vision  \n",
    "- The types of analyses you can perform  \n",
    "- How image analysis and object detection work  \n",
    "- The flexibility of custom model training  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Overview of OCI Vision\n",
    "OCI Vision is a managed **AI service for image understanding**.  \n",
    "It uses **deep learning-based models** to interpret and extract meaningful information from images.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It provides **two main capabilities**:\n",
    "1. **Image Analysis**  \n",
    "2. **Document AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both capabilities serve different purposes but rely on similar underlying machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Image Analysis\n",
    "The **Image Analysis** capability focuses on analyzing **photographic images**.  \n",
    "It can recognize and label objects, scenes, and text within those images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Object Detection\n",
    "- Detects and identifies **objects** within an image.  \n",
    "- Draws **bounding boxes** around each detected object.  \n",
    "- Assigns **labels** (e.g., “car,” “tree,” “person”) with an **accuracy score** (confidence percentage).  \n",
    "- Can also locate and extract **text** that appears in the image, such as words on signs or billboards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is valuable in applications such as:\n",
    "- Retail analytics  \n",
    "- Industrial inspection  \n",
    "- Security and surveillance  \n",
    "- Automated tagging in photo management systems  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Image Classification\n",
    "- Classifies the **overall content or theme** of an image.  \n",
    "- Assigns **classification labels** based on major visual features (e.g., “urban landscape,” “office,” “beach,” etc.).  \n",
    "- Helps automate tasks like organizing, searching, and tagging large image datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Document AI\n",
    "In addition to photographic image analysis, OCI Vision provides **Document AI** capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This feature focuses on analyzing **scanned or photographed documents**.  \n",
    "- It can extract **text, tables, and key-value pairs** from structured and unstructured documents.  \n",
    "- It is useful in business automation processes such as:\n",
    "  - Invoice and receipt processing  \n",
    "  - Identity verification  \n",
    "  - Legal and compliance document scanning  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Model Training and Customization\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of **OCI Vision** is its support for **custom model training**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Oracle’s **pretrained models**, you can:\n",
    "- **Retrain models** using your own labeled datasets.  \n",
    "- **Fine-tune** the model to detect objects or classify images based on your **specific business needs**.  \n",
    "- Improve accuracy and relevance for specialized domains — such as healthcare imaging, manufacturing defects, or agricultural analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility allows organizations to leverage AI-driven image analysis while keeping the models aligned with their unique data characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lesson, you learned that **OCI Vision** is Oracle’s **computer vision AI service** with two major capabilities — **Image Analysis** and **Document AI**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You explored:\n",
    "- How **Object Detection** identifies and labels items in images.  \n",
    "- How **Image Classification** categorizes scenes.  \n",
    "- The ability to **customize and retrain models** with organization-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining prebuilt models and customization options, OCI Vision empowers developers to create intelligent visual applications — from detecting objects in photos to extracting information from documents.\n",
