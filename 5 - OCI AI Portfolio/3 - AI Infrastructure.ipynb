    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore the importance of **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. We will understand what a GPU is, why it is essential for machine learning and AI workloads, and how it enables massive parallel processing for faster computation. Additionally, we will review the evolution of **NVIDIA GPU architectures** and see how they are used in **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** to power large-scale AI applications.\n",

    "## What is a GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** is a specialized hardware component designed for high-speed mathematical computations. Unlike a **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**, which has a few powerful cores optimized for sequential processing, GPUs contain **thousands of smaller, efficient cores** designed for parallel operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning and AI workloads involve **large-scale matrix multiplications and repetitive calculations** over vast datasets — tasks that are ideally suited for GPU acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why GPUs Are Required\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallel Computing:** GPUs are built to run thousands of processes simultaneously, allowing them to handle multiple data streams efficiently.  \n",
    "- **High Throughput:** By processing many inference tasks in parallel, GPUs provide faster training and inference compared to CPUs.  \n",
    "- **Optimization for AI Frameworks:** Modern deep learning frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **ONNX Runtime** leverage GPU-optimized libraries to maximize performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, GPUs are the backbone of **deep learning training**, **inference workloads**, and **large-scale AI model deployment**.\n",
    "\n",

    "|------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **A100** | 2020 | Ampere | Introduced Tensor Cores for fused multiply-accumulate operations to accelerate deep learning workloads. |\n",
    "| **H100** | 2022 | Hopper | Introduced a dedicated transformer engine to optimize transformer model performance. |\n",
    "| **H200** | 2024 | Hopper+ | Similar to H100 but with higher memory capacity for larger AI models. |\n",

    "## OCI GPU Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers a wide range of GPU-powered compute options to support small, medium, and large-scale use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OCI Compute with 10,800 H100N and L40 GPUs** is now generally available.  \n",
    "- **H200, B200, and GB200 superchips** are open for pre-order and will be available in **2025**.  \n",
    "- **Superclusters** built with these GPUs can achieve **up to 4× performance** over H100 systems, and **up to 8× with B200 and GB200** configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that organizations can scale their AI workloads efficiently, from experimentation to enterprise deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using GPUs in OCI Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "You can leverage **OCI AI Infrastructure** through **OCI Data Science** for both **training** and **deployment** of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deploy LLMs directly** to virtual machines or bare metal instances powered by GPUs using **OCI Data Science AI Quick Actions**.  \n",
    "- **Fine-tune base models** and **deploy custom models** for inference using the same Quick Actions workflow.  \n",
    "- **Register models** supported by **Virtual LLM**, **Next-Generation Inference**, or **Text-Embedding Inference Containers** within the OCI ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "GPUs are critical components of AI infrastructure. They provide the computational power necessary to train, fine-tune, and deploy deep learning models efficiently. With **NVIDIA’s latest architectures** and **OCI’s GPU-based infrastructure**, developers and data scientists can unlock new levels of AI performance for modern applications, including **large language models** and **cloud-based inference systems**.\n",
