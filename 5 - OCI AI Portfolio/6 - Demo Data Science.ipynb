    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step inside the notebook is usually creating a **Conda environment**.  \n",
    "OCI provides multiple pre-packaged Conda environments, each containing a set of libraries for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **Environment Explorer** to view available environments.  \n",
    "2. Expand any environment to see:  \n",
    "   - A brief **description**,  \n",
    "   - The list of **packages and libraries**, and  \n",
    "   - The **installation command**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install:\n",
    "1. Copy the installation command.  \n",
    "2. Open the **Terminal** from the Launcher.  \n",
    "3. Paste and execute the command to install the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, refresh the environment list to see your newly added kernel.  \n",
    "Select your desired Conda kernel (e.g., `generalml_p38`) and click **Create Notebook**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a ready-to-use **Jupyter Notebook** configured with all necessary libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration: Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, we will use the **Iris dataset** to train a simple machine learning model using the **Random Forest Classifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import Required Libraries\n",
    "Import Python libraries such as:\n",
    "- `pandas`  \n",
    "- `numpy`  \n",
    "- `sklearn` (for model building)  \n",
    "- `ads` (Oracle Accelerated Data Science SDK)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Load the Dataset\n",
    "Load the **Iris dataset** into a Pandas DataFrame.  \n",
    "You can view:\n",
    "- The **features** (input variables), and  \n",
    "- The **target variable** (species label).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Split the Data\n",
    "Split the dataset into:\n",
    "- **Training set** – for model training.  \n",
    "- **Testing set** – for model validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `train_test_split()` from scikit-learn to perform this split.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Train the Model\n",
    "Instantiate and train a **RandomForestClassifier** using the training data.  \n",
    "Once the model is trained, wrap it with the **ADS library** to automate the model lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the Model for Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Prepare the Model\n",
    "Call the `.prepare()` method to:\n",
    "- Generate the **model artifacts** (metadata, conda environment, inference script, etc.).  \n",
    "- Package everything needed for deployment without writing manual configuration code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Verify the Model\n",
    "Use `.verify()` to **simulate deployment** and **test predictions locally**.  \n",
    "This allows debugging and validation before publishing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The verification output shows:\n",
    "- Status of each stage: `initiate`, `prepare`, `verify`, `save`, `deploy`, and `predict`.  \n",
    "- Actions taken or required at each step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After verification, you’ll see successful predictions for sample data rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Save the Model\n",
    "Execute `.save()` to store the model artifact in the **OCI Model Catalog**.  \n",
    "This step registers the model for reuse and deployment within OCI.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the steps **initiate**, **prepare**, **verify**, and **save** are completed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Deployment and Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps (beyond this demo) involve:\n",
    "- Using `.deploy()` to create a **REST endpoint** for real-time inference.  \n",
    "- Using `.predict()` to invoke predictions through the deployed endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, we stop after saving the model, but the provided code includes these additional steps for you to explore later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Viewing the Model in OCI Console\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm the successful save operation:\n",
    "1. Return to your **Notebook Sessions** tab.  \n",
    "2. Click on **Models** in the left panel.  \n",
    "3. You will see your newly created **scikit-learn model** listed in the **Model Catalog**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that your model has been successfully registered within OCI Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we successfully replicated a complete machine learning workflow within **OCI Data Science**:\n",
