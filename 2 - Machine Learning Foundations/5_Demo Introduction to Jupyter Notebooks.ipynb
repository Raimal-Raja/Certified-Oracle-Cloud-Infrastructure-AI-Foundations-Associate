    "# 🐍 Introduction to Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👋 Welcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructor:** (Unnamed Presenter)  \n",
    "**Course:** OCI Foundations  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to our course on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Foundations**.  \n",
    "Before diving into our **machine learning use case**, let’s explore a powerful and essential tool for every aspiring data scientist — **Anaconda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧰 What is Anaconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda** is an **open-source distribution** of **Python and R** designed for **data science** and **machine learning**.  \n",
    "It simplifies **package management** and **deployment**, acting as a **complete toolbox** for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a preloaded toolkit containing **everything you need** to start your journey into **data analysis, machine learning, and AI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Why Use Anaconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several compelling reasons why **Anaconda** is one of the most popular tools in data science today:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Package Management**\n",
    "Anaconda makes it **extremely easy** to install, manage, and update Python libraries.  \n",
    "You don’t need to manually resolve dependencies — Anaconda handles that for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Environment Isolation**\n",
    "It allows you to **create separate environments** for different projects.  \n",
    "Each environment can have its **own version** of libraries and dependencies, preventing version conflicts between projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Anaconda Navigator**\n",
    "A **user-friendly graphical interface** that lets you:\n",
    "- Manage environments  \n",
    "- Install or remove packages  \n",
    "- Launch tools like **Jupyter Notebooks**  \n",
    "All of this can be done **without using the command line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**\n",
    "Anaconda runs seamlessly on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**, making it accessible to all developers and data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📓 Introducing Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary tool we’ll use in this course is the **Jupyter Notebook** — a powerful **interactive development environment (IDE)** that supports:\n",
    "- **Live code execution**  \n",
    "- **Mathematical equations**  \n",
    "- **Data visualizations**  \n",
    "- **Narrative explanations**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an excellent tool for:\n",
    "- **Prototyping machine learning models**  \n",
    "- **Data exploration**  \n",
    "- **Interactive documentation and presentations**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Launching Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "When you launch Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda:\n",
    "- It runs a **local server** on your machine.  \n",
    "- A **browser tab** automatically opens, displaying the notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll notice three main tabs in the interface:\n",
    "1. **Files** – Displays your folders and files.  \n",
    "2. **Running** – Lists currently active notebooks and terminals.  \n",
    "3. **Clusters** – Used for **parallel processing** (advanced usage, beyond this demo).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Creating Your First Project Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s walk through creating a new folder for our demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the **Files** tab, click **New Folder**.  \n",
    "2. A folder named **“Untitled”** appears.  \n",
    "3. Rename it to **“ML Demo”** by clicking on the folder name.  \n",
    "4. Open the **ML Demo** folder — you’ll see that it’s empty for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Creating a New Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s create a new Jupyter Notebook inside the **ML Demo** folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on **“New” → “Python 3 (ipykernel)”**.  \n",
    "2. A new notebook opens in a separate browser tab.  \n",
    "3. Rename it to **ML Demo 1**:\n",
    "   - Click on the title **“Untitled”** at the top.\n",
    "   - Enter **ML Demo 1**.\n",
    "   - Click **Rename**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your new Jupyter Notebook is now ready for coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ Writing and Running Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with a simple **Python program** to add two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧾 Step 1: Add a Comment\n",
    "In your first cell, write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This program adds two numbers\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Step 2: Define Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "### ➕ Step 3: Perform Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add two numbers\n",
    "sum = num1 + num2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ▶️ Step 4: Run the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute the cell by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clicking the **Run** button, or\n",
    "* Pressing **Shift + Enter** on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖨️ Step 5: Display the Result\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, print the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"The sum of {} and {} is {}\".format(num1, num2, sum))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the cell, the output will display:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The sum of 1 and 4 is 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple exercise demonstrates how **Jupyter Notebook** executes live code and displays results immediately — an excellent environment for experimentation and learning.\n",
